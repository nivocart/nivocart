ADVANCED SHOPPING CART SYSTEM

NivoCart is a fully featured shopping cart solution written in pure PHP, Html5, CSS3 and jQuery.<br />
NivoCart is completely self-contained, does not have any remote dependencies and does not use any frameworks, such as Bootstrap, or template engines, such as Twig. It uses the simple yet very efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" title="MVC">MVC</a> + L (Model-View-Controller + Language) file structure, for both the backend administration and the store(s) frontend.<br />
NivoCart is designed primarily for small and medium online business entrepreneurs, presenting them with an easy to use and reliable all-in-one shopping cart application to strengthen their online presence. The second objective of NivoCart is to give developers and web-design agencies a solid platform to work with, for the benefit of their respective clients.<br />
NivoCart is a community based project where everybody is welcome.<br />
Feel free to download it, clone it, test it and contribute to it.<br />

UPGRADE:

Same as the above INSTALLATION guidelines, but without steps 5 and 6:
