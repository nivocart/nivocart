INSTALLATION:

- 1 - Download the latest version of NivoCart.
- 2 - Upload the zip archive directly to your server (can be local or live).
- 3 - Unzip the archive in a temporary folder of your choice.
- 4 - Copy/Paste the content of the "upload" folder at the root of your domain.
- 5 - Find the 2 "config-dist.php" files (root and /admin) and rename them "config.php".
- 6 - Create an empty database on your server and give your username all privileges.
- 7 - Run the installer by entering "your domain/install/index.php" in your browser.
- 8 - Once you have completed the installer, simply login into your new Admin!


UPGRADE:

Same as the above INSTALLATION guidelines, but without steps 5 and 6:
- Do not overwrite your "config.php" files!  ... just Skip step 5.
- No need for a new database.  ... just Skip step 6.

Then, when running step 7, you will be presented with the Upgrade page instead.

Just click "Upgrade". Done!
